# PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING NATIONAL WORKSHOP Hi I attended 7 Days National Workshop on "Python And Machine Learning" from 07-13 June 2021, conducted by &lt;b> THE CODE SCHOLAR&lt;/b>.  &lt;br>I got to have hands on experience on: &lt;li>Python &lt;li>Machine Learning &lt;li>Project Understanding &lt;br> During these 7 days, everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.    The instructor during the session was Mr. Nitesh.  &lt;br>Speakers from different industry domains, lightened up the session with their experience.  I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with THE CODE SCHOLAR.&lt;br>  &lt;br>&lt;br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well&lt;br>   &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feCL8qbjgN0&amp;list=PL3Hnv9OFTJvW4zFKj0qXOpkoNe4AQTzCF&amp;index=1"> &lt;img src="https://github.com/thecodescholar/tcs_data/blob/main/PYTHON%20AND%20MACHINE%20LEARNING.png"> &lt;/a>   I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well.
